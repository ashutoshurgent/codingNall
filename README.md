In this repository I have added all the work that I have done during my MTech at Indian Institute of Delhi. 
I mainly worked on doing Performance Portability analysis of a heat solver and then developing a Stencil Solver.
I worked under the guidance of Prof Prapance Nair and I would certainly give all the credit to him for my learnings or whatever I could learn and earn during my Masters journey at IIT Delhi.
The code in this repository has been written in C++ and many parallelization techniques has been adapted..
Kokkos has also been implemented in most of my work.
